Fw: The 6 Best Ways To Easily Make Money on Swagbucks (paid out over $923 million until now)
To: phish.me.again@gmail.com <Phish.me.again@gmail.com>

De: *****Swagbucks*****

Enviado: segunda-feira, 28 de agosto de 2023 15:22

Para: phishing @ pot <merciayanmact @ hotmail.com>

Assunto: The 6 Best Ways To Easily Make Money on Swagbucks (paid out over $923 million until now)

Hello,

Please if you have not signed up yet on Swagbucks it is better to sign up here before starting fielelBest Ways! 10 Easily Make Money onl swagbucks, just to better understand
all the methods and options on the Swagbucks website.

Here is a quick overview of Swagbucks and reward sites in general if you are unfamiliar.
You can make money online by participating in a number of activities on these websites. Online purchasing, completing surveys, watching videos, playing games, and signing up
for offers are a few typical methods.

With Swagbucks, you are rewarded with points known as SBs. Then, you can either use your SBs to obtain cash through PayPal or exchange them for gift cards to retailers like
Amazon. Each SB is valued at around one cent.

While there are many other rewards sites like Swagbucks, few compare in terms of size, popularity, and reputation. In fact, Swagbucks has now paid out over $923
million in rewards to its members since it was launched in 2008.

Here are the strategies that, in my opinion, work best if you want to earn SBs fast.

#1. Shopping Online
Another simple way to earn SBs is to shop online, especially for purchases you were already planning to make.

Although these deals are uncommon, cash-back rates can reach up to 20%; at big stores, rates normally range between 2% and 10%.
If you receive 5% cash back on average on $500 in purchases each month, you will have earned $25 in gift cards or $300 in gift cards over the course of a year.
To increase your Swagbucks earnings in this manner, you must:
« Buy only what you would have bought anyhow to avoid blowing your money trying to rack up points.
« Look at the merchants that Swagbucks is promoting because you'll frequently find offers with discounts of over 10% there.
#2. Sign-Up Bonuses
For earning SBs fast, signing up for different services comes in at a very close second place, just behind money makers.

For example, current offers allow you to earn SBs by signing up for Chime (a free online bank account), Rocket Money (a budget tracker with other money-saving tools), and
Acorns (a micro-investing app).

Signing up for various services is second only to money producers in terms of how quickly one may earn SBs.
These sign-up bonuses are primarily for financial services.

For instance, current promotions let you earn SBs by signing up for Acorns, Rocket Money, and Chime (a free online bank account with other money-saving features) (a micro-
investing app).",/Users/tygovandenherik/Documents/Thesis/Screenshots/Fake_008.png

Reply-To: ftxnoticing@kroll.com

Dear Customer:

We would like to remind you that the FTX Customer Claims Bar Date is September 29, 2023,
4 PM United States Eastern Time (""Bar Date""). The Bar Date is the deadline to file proofs of
claim, against the FTX Debtors, on account of Customer Claims. We recommend all customers
with a customer claim to begin the claim process by logging in to the Customer Claims Portal at
https://claims.ftx.com. If you have already filed a proof of claim and do not have any changes,
then there is no need to file another claim.

Please note that the FTX Debtors have also requested KYC information as part of the customer
claim process. As such, we urge you to begin the Know Your Customer (""KYC"") process. Please
note that it is NOT mandatory for you to have a verified KYC status in order to submit a claim. If
you wish to submit a customer claim, you may do so during your KYC process prior to the Bar
Date. Additionally, you do not need to have your KYC process completed and verified by the Bar
Date. The KYC review and verification process will continue after the Bar Date.

Note that if your account was previously frozen as a result of the cybersecurity incident, please
refer to the separate communication sent on September 17, 2023.

Please visit the FTX support website at https://support.ftx.com to learn more about the customer

Re: NEED YOUR HELP
To: phishing

Dearest,
Greetings and blessings of the day to you.
Thanks so much for your urgent reply and | want you to know that it takes me time to write you an email because | was thinking who | will trust, like | asked you in my previous email, if | can trust you?.

But as | got your reply to my proposal letter | sent to you | was happy and | know we have not met before nor do we know each other before. The one word my late father always told me when he was alive, that
before | move on in life, | should know how to trust and also be careful of people | meet on my way.

Once again my name is Miss. Jane Konan, | am 19 years old. | am a citizen of Sierra Leone, but | am staying in Ivory Coast as a refugee now due to my present condition.
| have finished secondary school and left to enter university.

Please as | told you | need your help and assistance to secure my inheritance funds and invest it in a profitable business. The funds my late father kept in the bank here on my name before he died. The total
amount of the money is (US$16,750.000.00) and the money is in a bank here in Abidjan. And this fund is 100% genuine, clean and risk free.

My father was a very rich cocoa farmer and he dealt with other minerals like gold, crude oil and diamond. He's a very hard working man but he was poisoned to death by his evil relatives because of the big contract
he won.

While he was dying in the hospital, he told me everything and advised me to run out of Sierra Leone and seek a foreigner overseas who can help me, before his evil relatives would get me and kill me too. This is
how I ran down to Abidjan here, where | am presently staying in a refugee camp.

| want you to stand as my guardian before the bank and receive the money in your account and invest it in a profitable business on my behalf in your country, at my age | cannot handle such matters and | do not
want to risk my life, because this place is full of desperate people. | went to the bank here with the deposit document the bank had with my father and they confirmed it was clean and OK. And they are ready to
transfer the money through bank to bank wire transfer as soon as you stand as my guardian.

Please, | would like you to reply to me so that | will give you all the information about the bank, so that you can contact them.

And after that you will arrange for me to come over to your country and start a new life and continue my education.

Note: Please permit me to ask these few questions:

1. Can you really help me invest this money into a profitable business in your country?

2. Can you honestly help me as your daughter and keep this trust?

3. What percentage will be good for you after you have helped to transfer this money to your country?

4. If you agree to help me please send me your full details.

| have the original copies of deposit documents in my possession and | am ready to send it to you immediately, | confirm your sincerity to assist me.

| am waiting for your kind reply.

You're faithful.

Feedback: Thesis Proposal Presentation and next steps
To: Megan Liu, Cc: Onno Kindt, Paul van Eijkeren, Ivo Vioet, Malou vander Velde &6 more Details

Hi all,

First of all, congratulations to you all - you have successfully passed the thesis presentation stage - well done. | really enjoyed your
presentations and I'm happy you came well prepared. You all have received some comments, and | encourage you to use it to refine your work.
| look forward to seeing how your projects continue to develop.

As | mentioned, next week we will focus on the writing section. I'm going to soon send you an invite to the Teams meeting but this is only if you
can't attend in person.

In terms of your further analysis and next steps: before any analysis, data preprocessing is essential to ensure data quality and reliability:
handle any missing values, check for any duplicates or inconsistent data entries; check data distribution, any outliers, see what are the
relationships between your target, input, between features, etc. Encode categorical variables, and maybe you will need to apply log
transformations, or form/extract new features.

Then if you believe that you already have the clean/proper dataset, please make sure to avoid any data leakage before you start modelling. So
it means: you split your data before any preprocessing like normalization or SMOTE that needs to be performed on each split. Make sure you
don't have any overlapping samples in your train and test set e.g. no same participants in train and test sets. For time series make sure you do
a logical split and be careful that you train your model on past values to predict future values and do not mix any ""future values"" in the train set,
especially with rolling windows or lags. If you need any data augmentation, make sure that the samples do not end up in both the training and
test sets. We will go through these steps again, but | can't check each of your codes so you will have the responsibility to ensure that your
analysis is properly done. That's why | want you to keep very good documentation of your preprocessing and analysis steps so that if | ask to
explain how it was done, you are able to answer these questions. So it means if you use any code snippets from some forums or ChatGPT (or
any other tools), you still should be able to explain what you are doing and why.

Beste student,

Er is nog steeds een grote vraag naar studentenhuisvesting. Het is daarom dan ook een belangrijk onderwerp voor de

universiteit, waar we veel aandacht aan blijven besteden.

Gelukkig zijn de Nederlandse overheid en veel woningcorporaties bereid om in de toekomst hun capaciteit voor
studentenhuisvesting uit te breiden. Om zo goed mogelijk te weten waar studenten behoefte aan hebben, hebben ze
jouw hulp nodig. Wil jij helpen door deze korte enquéte van ongeveer tien minuten in te vullen?

Dear all,

Thank you for attending the third lecture on Data Processing Advanced in which we
learned about vectorized operations, broadcasting, and linear algebra in NumPy. |
have released all the lecture materials including the the lecture recordings, notebook,
slides, and daily exercises and they should be accessible under Week 3: Vectorization
and Linear Algebra.

Please also have a look and try the daily exercises and the example exam question
before attending the practical sessions.

To answer your questions during the lecture and to make the concept behind
broadcasting clearer, | have added a webpage and an Al-generated Podcast on the
motivation behind broadcasting with a practical example. You can access these
materials at On the importance of broadcasting in NumPy .

If you have any further questions or concerns regarding the first lecture, you can share
them on Week 3: Numpy Vectorization and Linear Algebra Discussion, General
Questions, or Anonymous Discussion boards.

Good luck with learning about NumPy arrays and hopefully see you again next week
when we are going to start learning about Pandas!

Overall feedback on your Research Thesis Proposal Draft
To: Patrick Miéetié

Hi all,

Thank you for submitting your thesis proposal drafts, | have read them all, and you should be able to find my comments on your file on Canvas. Here is some overall feedback, which may not apply to all of you but should be relevant to some. Please take these points into consideration when preparing your final thesis proposal.

1. Use the Correct Template: Please ensure that you use the official thesis template, which is available on Canvas. | have previously shared the link.
2. Literature Review & Introduction: when discussing claims such as ""increasing demand"" or ""models are widely used"", always back them up with credible sources. Avoid merely listing studies—create a coherent story that connects different studies, explains their relevance to your research question, or gives a reader an understanding of why it matters. When describing

model performance (e.g., ""outperforms other models""), be specific—does it perform 1-2% better or 10-20% better, which models outperform what?
3. Citing sources properly: Always properly cite the source of your dataset. If you obtained it from an open-source platform, follow their citation guidelines. If your dataset is confidential (e.g., from a company with an NDA), acknowledge that even if you do keep it anonymous. Please cite Python libraries and models used in your research (and yes, include them in the

bibliography).

4. Your proposal should include a clear timeline outlining key milestones for data collection, analysis, and writing (and please properly look at what's feasible to achieve given this time frame, it's for you, not for me).

5. Research Questions & Analysis: Each research question and subquestion must be answered through analysis. When drafting your questions, ensure you know what kind of analysis you will conduct to answer them (e.g., comparing models on accuracy, analyzing feature importance, evaluating model performance across age groups, etc.).
If you do not yet have a dataset, this should be your main priority unless you have a clear agreement on when/that you will receive the dataset (e.g., you are working on an external project and you are waiting to sign an NDA).

Your draft has been marked as ""completed"" because this assignment is not graded. However, your final thesis proposal will be evaluated based on the official evaluation criteria, so, please take my comments into account.

I'm looking forward to meeting you next time and please bring any questions you have regarding your final proposal/my comments if something is not clear, etc.

For those who already have the dataset and clear research direction/questions, please, work on your dataset i.e. what features do you have, does it require any data preprocessing, do you have any missing values, what kind of data structure you have, what's your score distribution, etc. And then focus on your literature - do you know what other models have been used,
what are the scores that they achieved, which features they used, etc. It's important to have an (some) understanding of the field and what has been done before.

Kind regards,
Judita

Dear students,

The inspection can be self-administered remotely. !! Please note your TestVision
files will only be accessible between February 5, 2025 9:00 AM and February 6,
2025 5:00 PM, once you have your submitted files, you can carry out the inspection at

a later time.

a.
b.

Download your submitted .py files from TestVision (instructions)
After (whenever is convenient): download the inspection file (here)

If your inspection grade is higher than noted on Canvas, you likely made
a mistake somewhere. Check all required steps again (carefully).

If you're confident there is an error in the inspection file, please let us
know by February 7th. This does not affect your grade.

If files on TestVision are missing or do not match what you submitted: we
can't do anything about this, unfortunately. We'd encourage you to triple
check the files are actually submitted in case you are retaking the course.

The inspection allows you to review the answers, it is not intended to dispute your
grade (see grading policy).

Kind regards,
